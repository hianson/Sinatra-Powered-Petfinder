### What this is:
This was my first lesson in using web APIs. This simple Sinatra web app uses HTTParty to hit Petfinder's API to get and display information about a random pup which is up for adoption.

### Make it work:
You'll need an API key from Petfinder, found here: https://www.petfinder.com/developers/api-docs

1. Clone repo
2. Create '.env' file inside Sinatra-Powered-Petfinder directory
3. In .env file: PETFINDER_API_KEY=key
4. Run Sinatra with "bundle exec shotgun" in CLI
5. Reach app using localhost:9393 in browser!
